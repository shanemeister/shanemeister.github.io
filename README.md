This is he start of my personal portfolio for full stack development. Hoping to develop some things of interest here at some point. 

Actually, I am not sure how much I will use this web site, since I have one already at [https://www.rshane.com](https://www.rshane.com). 

I want to apply this coding knowledge I am gaining, coupled with AWS' CodeWhisperer, or Google's Duet AI to develop some applications quicker than was previously possible. Since I wrote that, I have temporarily adopted Git CoPilot as well.

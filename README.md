This is he start of my personal portfolio for full stack development. Hoping to develop some things of interest here at some point. 

Actually, I am not sure how much I will use this web site, since I have one already at [https://www.rshane.com](https://www.rshane.com). 

I want to apply this coding knowledge I am gaining, coupled with AWS' CodeWhisperer, or Google's Codey to develop some applications quicker than was previously possible.

I have done a lot of coding in my career, but I spend 6 months learning and applying the code, and don't do it again for 5 years. For me, this is how Generative AI is going to be huge advantage, at least I think so.

That's it for now, goodbye!
